## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The ability for a user to securly login to an application to store their data is crucial. Think about all the times you have signed up for an app using your facebook or google account. That is done through a process called OAuth. Essientially, the app allows “someone else” (an external identity “provider”) to take care of making sure that you are who you say you are.
